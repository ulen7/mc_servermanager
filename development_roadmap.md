## **Getting Started**

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Pick one feature from Phase 1.1** that excites you most
2. **Create a branch** for that feature
3. **Break it down** into smaller tasks (1-2 hours each)
4. **Build, test, repeat**

### **Recommended Starting Point:**
**Command History Navigation** - It's immediately useful, teaches good JavaScript practices, and you'll use it every day!

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Notes**

- **Time estimates** are for learning + implementation (expect 2x if completely new)
- **Each phase builds** on previous phases
- **Features can be reordered** based on what excites you most
- **Phase 3 Discord integration** can be moved up if that's your priority!
- **Always test with your actual server** - dogfooding is the best way to find issues

*Happy coding! Remember: the best feature is the one you'll actually use. Start with what bothers you most about the current console.* ðŸŽ®
